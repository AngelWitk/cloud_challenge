Task 1 - part 1 

I used Cloud SDK.


Step 1️⃣
Check the GCP docs to get a command to list enabled services in your project.

Step 2️⃣
Copy the returned list to a file in your cloud_challenge repository called enabled_services


Task 1 - part 2 - optional

Using the docs, figure out how to produce a gcloud command to create a budget in GCP. Create the budget and then list all budgets using gcloud.
